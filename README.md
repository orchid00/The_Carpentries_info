# The Carpentries info

## Hi Welcome! 

This is a summary of best practices that Instuctors from The Carpentries use during workshops. If you haven't yet been in one of the Instructor Training Workshops and you are going (or likely going) to teach a short course, I would very much recommend you to have a look at these tips.

## Materials based on the Carpentries template
These are not official carpentries lessons which use the carpentries template, and are ready to be explored.
* [The Carpentries style shared lessons](https://orchid00.github.io/The_Carpentries_info/carpentries_style_shared_lessons)

Please let me know if there are any lessons out there that would be good to add to this list for the purpose of reuse and share :)
