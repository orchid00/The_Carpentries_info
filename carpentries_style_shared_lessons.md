# Carpentries style materials

Here are a collection of Carpentries style lessons. These are not part of the official carpentries curriculum, but are a good source of inspiration whenever you need them. Would be awesome if you could add examples! please contact [me](https://twitter.com/orchid00). 

If you want your lessons to be part of the currilumn you can propose them to [The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals): The Incubator will serve as a single point of entry for lessons or ideas at any stage in the development process.

## R

- Git using Rstudio https://stijnvanhoey.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/ This is a short lesson to teach git from RStudio 
using The Carpentries style version 9.5.0. proposed by Stjin van Hoey, you can contact @orchid00 if you have questions.
- https://tibhannover.github.io/FAIR-R/ -- Fork of r-novice-inflammation that focusses on function docu, packaging & testing. 
Was used in https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/
- https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/ --a condensed version of the Software Carpentry intro to R lesson, 
with tidyverse and a bit of modeling thrown in.
- Quantitative Trait Mapping https://smcclatchy.github.io/mapping/ This lesson introduces genetic mapping using qtl2, a R package for analyzing quantitative phenotypes and genetic data from complex crosses like the Diversity Outbred (DO).
 
## Python

## Shell

## Git - Version Control

- Customised from git - https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/ - Teaches branches and pull requests
- CodeRefinery git intro https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ - Guacamole example
- Collaborative distributed version control https://coderefinery.github.io/git-collaborative/ - Working with remotes, pull requests, and code review
- Git branch design https://coderefinery.github.io/git-branch-design/ - Rebase vs. merge, avoiding conflicts, branching models
- Git - Github - Rstudio https://inbo.github.io/git-course/
- Steve Bond (Biologyguy)'s Git and Github with examples that make more sense IRL: https://biologyguy.github.io/git-novice/
Two hour edition targeted at IT pros based on this version: https://dlstrong.github.io/git-novice/. I teach 
this as a full day lesson, and use a cut-down version for SWC workshops: http://gcapes.github.io/git-course. Writing a paper 
as the narrative, covers branches, revert, reset, rebase, remotes, PRs.
- Modified version of git-novice that uses Git Desktop and uses editing a carpentry data file as example: 
https://caltechlibrary.github.io/git-desktop/
- SWC https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/ - Teaches branches and pull requests
- Git beyond the basics https://m4rkd.github.io/git-beyond-the-basics/

## SQL
- SQL for Business https://data-lessons.github.io/SQL-business/ This lesson will teach you what relational databases are,
how you can load data into them and how you can query databases to extract just the information that you need.

## Docker / Singularity - Containers
 
- Reproducible computational environments using containers https://dme26.github.io/docker-introduction/
- https://neurohackweek.github.io/docker-for-scientists/

## HPC - High Performance Computing
 
- HPC Carpentry: https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/
Made up of 1/2 day lessons that can be combined together in different ways depending on the audience
  - hpc-shell: Intro to the shell for people using remote advanced computing systems
  - hpc-intro: intro to using HPC systems
- A one day workshop introducing parallel programming using MPI. https://rantahar.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/

## GAP -  computational algebra
- http://alex-konovalov.github.io/gap-lesson/ by Alex Konovalov

## Genomics
- Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases - computer practical
https://aschuerch.github.io/MolecularEpidemiology_AnalysisWGS/index.html
- Molecular Basis of Bacterial Infections course, computer practical https://aschuerch.github.io/MBBI_ComputerPracticum/

## Data Stewardship
- 23 (Research Data) Things https://data-lessons.github.io/23-rd-things/ 23 (research data) Things is a self-guided
training concept for anybody interested in data.
- Data and the FAIR Principles http://www.repronim.org/module-FAIR-data/ This module provides a number of lessons
to ensure that a researcher’s data is properly managed and published to ensure it enables reproducible research.
